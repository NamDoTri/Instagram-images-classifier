# Instagram-images-classifier
This is an activity in course Applied Data Science which I attended during my exchange programme at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.  
Images for this project was collected using a script in directory ./instagram  
The notebook, which serves as the final deliverable of the course, documents my experiments in building a classifier which, given a set of images from certain Instagram accounts, can classify which image belong to whom. Performance of the classifiers in this project is lower than anticipated due to the lack of time for data preparation as well as an in-depth knowledge of the topic.  
Due to its large size, the notebook can't be rendered in Github. A more aesthetically pleasing render of the notebook can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/shorturl.at/CFG59).
